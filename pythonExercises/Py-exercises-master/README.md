Within these files are a handfull of the solutions to basic 
exercises that I've  (mostly) completed using Python 
throughout the winter leading up to this point. 

Decided to upload these so that others may be able to gain insight 
into my coding style, and so that I have something to look at in the 
future so that I can see my progress.

NOTE: 
Took a long break, going through the "AntiTextBook" course as a refresher before resuming daily random exercises
